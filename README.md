# Question DB
This is the database repo for an application I am developing called Question. 

## Question Application 
Question is a diagnostic tool and symptom tracker. Itâ€™s 2 main functions are:
1. Manage and document the process of problem solving.
2. Log and aggregate data about the symptoms of problems.

Each data point in Question is assigned to a type such as 'Subject' or 'Description', and that data gets displayed in the UI as a tree:

Question is a [local-first](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first/) application.
